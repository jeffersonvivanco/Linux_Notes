# CentOS Linux
CentOS Linux is a community-supported distribution derived from sources freely provided to the
public on **Red Hat** or **CentOS git** for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). As such, CentOS linux
aims to be functinoally compatible with RHEL. The CentOS Project mainly changes packages to remove upstream
vendor branding and artwork. CentOS linux is no-cost and free to redistribute. Each CentOS version is
maintained until the equivalent RHEL version goes out of general support. A new CentOS version is
made available once a new RHEL version is rebuilt - approximately every 6 - 12 months for minor point
releases and several years for major version bumps. The length of time the rebuild takes varies
from weeks for point releases to months for major version bumps. This results in a secure,
low-maintance, reliable, predicatable and repoducible Linux environment.
